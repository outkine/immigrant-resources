        <h1>Illinois</h1>
        <p>The legislation that defines Illinois immigration policy is the TRUST Act. Signed in 2017, it makes it easier for undocumented immigrants to live in Illinois. The act includes two key provisions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Local law enforcement cannot detain on behalf of ICE.</li>
          <li>Local officials cannot inquire about immigration status.<sup>9</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second provision is especially important, as it overrides the precent set by <em>Arizona v. United States</em>. This means that illegal immigrants should be significantly more comfortable with reporting crimes to the police.</p>
        <p>One of the largest issues facing police departments around the country is a decreased rate of crime reports from the immigrant community - for example, sexual assault and domestic violence are down as much as 50 percent<sup>10</sup>. The TRUST act is a good first step towards building better relationships between community members and police departments.</p>
