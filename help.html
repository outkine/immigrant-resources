    <p>There has recently been a lot of turmoil in the US in regards to immigration. The Trump administration made several important decisions, including imposing a travel ban on Muslim countries and repealing DACA. In order to understand the backlash, it's important to take into account some history.</p>
    <p>One of the first mentions of immigration in the constitution occurs in Section 8 of Article I, and entrusts the legislative branch with the power “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization”1, or regulate immigration. Congress only actively got involved in this process in the late 18th century, however. Here is a timeline of US government actions that paved the way for modern-day immigration laws.</p>

        <p>Starting with the Passenger Cases, the Supreme court began to set a precedent for only allowing the federal government to regulate Immigration policy. The Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the first examples of this, and acted as a clear message that Congress had the ultimate say.</p>
        <p>This precedent was tested in Hines v. Davidowitz, were Pennsylvania claimed that because similar legislation did not exist on a federal level, its legislation could coexist with federal regulations. The court ruled that only the federal government utlimately had the power to regulate immigrants. According to the court,</p>

          <p>[S]tates cannot, inconsistently with the purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail or comple­ment, the federal law, or enforce additional or auxiliary regulation.</p>

    <p>As the number of undocumented immigrants increased, so did the amount of attention dedicated to them. One good example of this occured in the form of Arizona v. United States, where Arizona increased the punishments for being undocumented within its borders. The Supreme Court didn’t strike down all the parts of that law, however. It maintained that law authorities could and should check the undocumented status of legally detained individuals.</p>
    <p>The Trump administration has passed two major pieces of legislation on immigration. The first is the Travel Ban, which has been revised three times. The first two versions were struck down by [INSERT INFORMATION], and while the third revision is currently going under effect, Trump v. Hawaii is still being decided on by the Supreme Case and could reverse that.</p>
