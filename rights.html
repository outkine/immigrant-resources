        <p>There has recently been a lot of turmoil in the US in regards to immigration. The Trump administration made several important decisions, including imposing a travel ban on Muslim countries and repealing DACA. In order to understand the backlash, it's important to take into account some history.</p>
        <p>One of the first mentions of immigration in the constitution occurs in Section 8 of Article I, and entrusts the legislative branch with the power “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization”<sup>1</sup>, or regulate immigration. Congress only actively got involved in this process in the late 18th century, however. Here is a timeline of US government actions that paved the way for modern-day immigration laws.</p>

            <p>Starting with the Passenger Cases, the Supreme court began to set a precedent for only allowing the federal government to regulate Immigration policy. The Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the first examples of this, and acted as a clear message that Congress had the ultimate say.</p>
            <p>This precedent was tested in <em>Hines v. Davidowitz</em>, were Pennsylvania claimed that because similar legislation did not exist on a federal level, its legislation could coexist with federal regulations. The court ruled that only the federal government utlimately had the power to regulate immigrants. According to the court,</p>

              <p>[S]tates cannot, inconsistently with the purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail or comple­ment, the federal law, or enforce additional or auxiliary regulation.<sup>3</sup></p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>As the number of undocumented immigrants increased, so did the amount of attention dedicated to them. One good example of this occured in the form of <em>Arizona v. United States</em>, where Arizona increased the punishments for being undocumented within its borders. The Supreme Court didn’t strike down all the parts of that law, however. It maintained that law authorities could and should check the undocumented status of legally detained individuals.</p>
        <p>The Trump administration has passed two major pieces of legislation on immigration. The first is the Travel Ban, which has been revised three times. The first version banned foreigners from predominantly Muslim countries from vising the US for 90 days, suspended access to all Syrian refugees, and prohibited all other refugees fo r120 days. After facing backlash from a number of federal courts, Trump released a revised version of the ban that exempted foreigners with visas and green cards, as well as everyone from Iraq. After facing more backlash, he released a final, third version, this one only focused on stopping travel from predominantly Muslim countries and North Korea. Second circuit and federal courts still upheld their block, but the Supreme Court allowed the new version to go into effect while it reviews the 3.0 ban in <em>kHawaii v. Trump.</em><sup>5</sup></p>
        <p>One of Trump's biggest campaign promises was repealing DACA, which is an Obama-age legislation aimed at protecting undocumented immigrant children.</p>
        <div class="brief">
          <p class="title">DACA (<a href="https://undocu.berkeley.edu/legal-support-overview/what-is-daca/">more information</a>)</p>
          <p>What does it do?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gives protection from deportation</li>
            <li>Gives a work permit</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What are the eligability requirements?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Under 31 years on June 15, 2012</li>

        <p>This repeal was contested, and the DACA program is still taking renewels. However, the program has indefinetely delayed all new applications. This, in many ways, is proof that the US is still struggling to acknowledge and protect all new immigrants. While history has seen many cases and acts aimed at protecting immigrants, many states still deny many benefits to undocumented immigrants<sup>2</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>However, it is important to remember that every person in the United States is still entitled to the fundamental rights listed in the constitution (<a href="./government.html">see sumaries</a>). One of these is a right to due process, which was reaffirmed by <em>Zadvydas v. Davis</em>:
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
          <img src="assets/quote.svg">
          <p>But once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all “persons” within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.<sup>7</sup></p>
        </div>
        <p>One other key right is the protection from unlawful searches and seizures. This right has been especially contested with the recent increases in ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) searches and seizures. In general, ICE may not search or enter your home unless they have a warrant.<sup>8</sup></p>
         <div class="brief">
          <p class="title">ICE FAQ (<a href="https://www.nilc.org/get-involved/community-education-resources/know-your-rights/imm_enfrcmt_homework_rts_2008-05-2/">more information</a>)</p>
          <p class="question">Can ICE enter my home?</p>
          <p>Law enforcement agencies can only enter with a warrant, or a special government document authorizing a search or arrest. Only open the door for law enforcement that has proven that they have a valid warrant. You cannot be forced into allowing entry.</p>
          <p class="question">Can ICE enter my work?</p>
          <p>Law enforcement agencies are usually not allowed to enter workplaces. If an officer gets permission, remember that you have a right to stay silent and a right to speak to a lawyer before answering questions.</p>
          <p class="question">How can I protect myself?</p>
          <p>Make sure that you know who to reach out to in case of an emergency. Also investigate immigration attorneys that could help in the case of your detainment.<sup>8</sup></p> 
        </div> 
        <p>Knowing and remembering all of your rights is one of the best ways to stay safe.</p>
